# Codeigniter Installation for Beginners

Before you continue reading this guide why not try a more easy way, using the [Koding Package Manager (kpm)](http://learn.koding.com/guides/getting-started-kpm/) and install Codeigniter using just one command:

```
kpm install codeigniter
```

***

In this article we will go over installing Codeigniter for beginners.

## What is Codeigniter?

Codeigniter may be old hat to some, but the tried and true frameworks tend to hold their own for quite a long time, and for good reason. It is polished, has an extensive history, and above all has a large community to back it up. 

## So how do i get started with Codeigniter?

Before you begin make sure you are in your Web folder:

```
cd Web
```

First you will need to download the latest version of Codeigniter using the following command, in your Terminal:

```
wget https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/archive/2.2-stable.zip
```

After that you'll need to unzip the file using the command:

```
unzip 2.2-stable.zip
```

Next we need to rename the folder to a more friendly one:

```
mv CodeIgniter-2.2-stable codeigniter
```

You will now be able to access Codeigniter by following a similar URL:

```
http://KODING_USERNAME.koding.io/codeigniter
```

Find out more about your VM hostname [here](http://learn.koding.com/faq/vm-hostname/).

Koding comes with Apache by default, so Codeigniter _just works_.

As you can see, setting up CodeIgniter is a pretty simple process.
