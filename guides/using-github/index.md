# Getting started with Git on Koding using Ungit

This guide will cover the basics on how to get started with Github on you Koding VM using Ungit.

## What is Ungit?

[Ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit) is a web based interface for Github made by [Fredrik Noren](https://github.com/FredrikNoren) that runs on any platform. It has a clean and intuitive UI that makes it easy to understand git. It runs on any platform that node.js & git supports and it works well with GitHub. 

## Getting started

Before we begin please make sure you the Koding Package Manager (KPM) installer on your VM. Follow [this guide](http://learn.koding.com/kpm) to understand wha KPM is and how to install it so you will be able to continue with this guide.

## Setup

__Please note that git is installed by default with every Koding VM. So you will be able to get started right away.__

Before you can get started with Github on your Koding VM you need to first setup the environment to be able to work properly with Github.

Run the following command, in your Koding Terminal, to install the necessary dependency:

```
npm install ungit
```

This will install a visually friendly interface for Github, where you will be able to interact with Github and your Koding VM. Think of it as a bridge between Koding and Github.

After the installation process has finished you will need to start the Github interface using the following command:

```
ungit
```

When the process has finished you should see a link outputted in the Terminal similar to this one:

```
your_koding_username.koding.io:8448
```

Copy that link and open it in a separate browser window. You should see something like this:

## Basic interaction

In the top area of the screen, in the input box you will be able to input the path to a local existing repository on your Koding VM or start with a fresh empty one.

__Please note that the input field has autocomplete__

Start with a basic path like this one. Just make sure that folder exists before you input the path. If that folder doesn’t exist then you will be able to create it using this interface.

```
/home/your_koding_username/Web/demo
```

After that hit **Enter || Return**
 
You should see something like this:

Now, you can either transform that folder into a git repository or clone a repository in a subfolder in that folder.

Let’s transform this folder into a git repository. After transformation is complete just hit the little `+` sign at the top next to path, in order to see repository on the main view of the interface.

Before we continue, please make sure you have a Github repository ready in your Github account. Now you have to link that repository to your local Koding one using the Add new remote modal.

Copy the URL from your Github repository in this modal window and hit Submit.

Now head over to the Koding IDE and start adding code to your newly created repository. After you finished with your changes, you should already see you changes in the Ungit interface, just ready to be committed to your Github repository.

After you have named your commit, hit the commit button.

Now you can push your changes to the desired branch in your Github repository. Click on the name of the branch and then on the Push button.

You will be required to input your Github username and password before you can push your changes.

Input them, so you can continue with pushing your changes. After that you should see a successful commit of your changes.

Cloning an existing repository is a really straightforward process.

In order to clone a repository we need to have a location where we want to store our cloned repository.

Following the first step from above, in the input field at the top of Ungit select your desired path. For eg.

```
/home/your_koding_username/Web
```

Now you can clone any desired repository in this folder using this form:

![Using Githug 6](ungit6.png)

Just copy the repository URL from Github, in the input field and then hit Clone repository. 

Wait for the cloning process to finish and now you should see all the commit history and you are now able to work on that repository, perform commits, push changes, using the Koding IDE.

__Note: Whenever you turn on Koding VM you will have to run the `ungit` command to get this interface started.__
