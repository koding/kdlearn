# Koding with Sublime Text

## What you will need

- Your [Koding](https://koding.com) username
- Your [Koding](https://koding.com) VM Number
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) 2 or 3

## Getting Down to Business

1. Download [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2) and use the Package Control: Install Package command from the command palette. The command palette is opened via ctrl+shift+p on Windows and Linux, and cmd+shift+p on OS X.

2. Once you run the Package Control: Install Package command, a list of packages will appear.

3. Type in SFTP and hit enter. Using Package Control ensures Sublime SFTP will stay up to date automatically.

4. Open a folder with Sublime Text

6. You should now see `sftp-config.json` opened.

7. Configure your `sftp-config.json` file and save it.

  ```
  "host": "<vm-number>.<username>.koding.kd.io",
  "user": "<username>",
  "password": "<koding_password>",
  //"port": "22",
    
  "remote_path": "/home/glang/",
  ```

   Modify the other configurations if you wish. I personally find the option to `upload_on_save` very handy.

8. Right click the folder, select `SFTP/FTP`. You will now see many more options than before.

9. (**IMPORTANT**) Chose whether you want to `Sync Local -> Remote` or `Sync Remote -> Local`. Be very careful about which you choose.

   `Sync Local -> Remote` overwrites what you have in your remote directory that you specified in you `sftp-config.json` file with what you have in your local directory.
