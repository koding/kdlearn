[Git](http://git-scm.com/) has become an integral part of the modern software development cycle. As per Wikipedia, Git
"is a distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005."
