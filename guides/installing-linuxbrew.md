# Installing LinuxBrew

There are a variety of package installers to help with what would otherwise be complex installations. Follow these instructions to install HomeBrew for Linux.

## The One-Line Solution

Input the following in your shell, as Koding already has Ruby pre-installed

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew/go/install)"
```

From here, you’ll be poised for yet more installations. See [their website](http://brew.sh/linuxbrew “Linux Brew”) for more information.
