# DRAFT 5 Easy steps to getting started with Drupal on Koding

**What is Drupal?**
Drupal is an open source content management platform powering millions of websites and applications. It’s built, used, and supported by an active and diverse community of people around the world. [Learn more](http://drupal.org).

Getting started with your own Drupal environment on Koding is as simple as following these 5 easy steps!

**Step 1: **
To install Drupal on Koding, run the **[Drupal Installer App](https://koding.com/Drupal)**. [Note: you have to be 
logged into your [Koding account](https://koding.com/Login) in order to run the app.]
