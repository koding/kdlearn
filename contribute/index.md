# Author A Guide

In this guide series we will go over Writing and Editing guides for Koding 
University. We will cover every step of the process, but basic Git, 
Github, and Markdown knowledge will be *very* useful.

If you already know git, github, and markdown, here is the simple set of 
tasks you'll need to do.

1. Review the [Style Guidelines][guidelines]
1. Fork [KDLearn][repo]
2. Clone your forked repo
3. Find or create your files, Make your markdown edits
4. Commit and push your changes to your repo
5. Make a pull request of your changes, against the [KDLearn Repo][repo]

If you need more in depth instructions than that, please continue with 
this series below. Thanks!
