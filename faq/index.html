        <p><a href="https://koding.com">Koding</a> is a robust and feature rich cloud-based development environment complete with free virtual machines (VMs), an attractive IDE and sudo level terminal access. Your ideal software development playground and everything you need to move your software development to the cloud! A Koding VM has many of the popular software packages and programming languages preinstalled so that you can focus on learning vs installing and configuring.</p>
<p>You will be up and running in minutes on your own cloud-based Linux boxes where you can learn programming languages like Ruby, Go, Java, NodeJS, PHP, C, C++, Perl, Python&#x2026;the list goes on! You can experiment with installing, configuring/hacking WordPress, Laravel, Django, Bootstrap and a slew of others or fire up a MySQL, Mongo, or Postgres server with the click of a button. If clicking buttons is not your thing (yes, we are that way too!) then you also have your favorite vim and emacs right there.</p>
<p>Our collaboration features allow you to pair-program with your friends and colleagues by allowing you to share (in real-time) your online IDE, Terminal and white board. All Koding virtual machines come with full root access so you are not hindered in any way.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to localhost!</p>

        <h3 class="heading"> <a name="earning-free-referral-space" class="anchor" href="#earning-free-referral-space"></a> Earning free referral space </h3><p>You can earn up to 500MB per referral on Koding. Earning referrals is as easy as
inviting your friends, colleagues, classmates, students, etc. to join Koding!</p>
<p>To get started, head over to <a href="https://koding.com/Account/Referral">Account Settings</a> and
grab your personalized referral link (see location details in the graphic below).
You can then use the easy to use social media share buttons to distribute your personal
referral link or send/share the link directly via your preferred distribution method.</p>
<p><img src="/faq/redeem-referrals/referral.png" alt="referrals"></p>
<p>Each <strong>new</strong> user who signs up and verifies a Koding account earns you 500MB in extra
storage space! Your friend also gets an extra 500MB. It&apos;s a win-win!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The maximum storage that can be earned via referrals is 7GB (or 14 referrals) which
means you can grow the storage of your free Koding account to 10GB (3GB default + 7GB earned
through referrals). Referrals can be earned by paid or free accounts. The maximum earned storage
limit is the same for both types.</p>
<blockquote class="tip fa fa-check-circle"> <p><span class="label">tip</span>The section below outlines how you can redeem space once you have earned it. Please
note that redemption can only happen in multiples of whole number GBs. Read more below.</p>
 </blockquote><h3 class="heading"> <a name="redeeeming-your-earned-referral-storage" class="anchor" href="#redeeeming-your-earned-referral-storage"></a> Redeeeming your earned referral storage </h3><p>If you have earned extra stroage space on your Koding account as a result of referrals
or other offers we&apos;ve made available to our users, then reclaiming that earned space
is now easier than ever.</p>
<blockquote class="alert fa fa-exclamation-circle"> <p><span class="label">alert</span>Before we proceed, please note that referral space can only be claimed in increments of
whole number GBs. That means if you have referred one person and earned 500MB (0.5GB) then
you will need to wait until another person signs up using your referral link so that you get to a
whole number (1GB) of earned space which can then be redeemed by following the process
outlined below.</p>
 </blockquote><p>To add earned space to your VM, head over to <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/understanding-vm-panel/">VM settings</a> and click the plus sign located
next to the disk size indicator (as shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img src="/faq/redeem-referrals/resizedisk.png" alt="disk size indicator"></p>

        <p>The <code>kdopen</code> command does just that! </p>
<p>First you need to install <code>kdopen</code> using our <code>kpm</code> <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/getting-started-kpm/">package manager</a>. Type the following command in Terminal to set up the required components for <code>kdopen</code>:</p>
<pre><code>kpm <span class="hljs-keyword">install</span> kdbin
</code></pre><blockquote class="tip fa fa-check-circle"> <p><span class="label">tip</span>If kpm itself is not installed, you can install it using the command 
<code>curl -sSL learn.koding.com/kpm.sh | sh</code></p>
 </blockquote><p>Once <code>kdbin</code> is installed, you can now type the following command in Terminal
to open a file in the Koding Editor:</p>
<pre><code>kdopen <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">filename</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p><code>kdopen</code> supports wildcards so if you type:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">kdopen</span> <span class="hljs-regexp">*.html</span>
</code></pre><p>it will open each file with the extension <code>.html</code> (in the current directory) in its own tab on the Editor.</p>
<p>If you are opening a file that does not exist, <code>kdopen</code> will create the file first
and then open it up. The file will be created in the current directory.</p>

        <p>In short no. Sorry :(</p>
<p>Why...? It&apos;s because when you first create your account we provision a lot of support services in the background for your account and all of these would need to get updated. This becomes problematic if you have made changes to your VM (even if you have created one file). If you really want to change your username, the only option is to delete your current account and make a new one with the desired username.</p>
<p>But ... you can however , change your display name as seen associated with your the bulletin board posts. Just browse to <a href="https://koding.com/Account/Profile">https://koding.com/Account/Profile</a> where you may change &quot;Name&quot; and/or &quot;LastName&quot; as you would like them to appear to other koding users wherever you chat on koding. This quite niftily has the side-effect of changing your nick on all of you past postings instantaneously. Note that this feature does not in any way allow you to be anonymous. Anyone who clicks on your chat nick (whatever it may be at the time) will always see your canonical username in the URL of your profile.</p>
<p>So to be clear , you may change your display name at any time but this does not affect your login username or VM URL. As stated above that is your system UID and can not be changed.</p>

        <p>Our computer screens come in all shapes and sizes and if you don&apos;t have a high res screen,
then the amount of space occupied by the VM panel/sidebar and the file tree can be a bit
too much. Did you know that both the VM panel/sidebar and file tree can be collapsed?</p>
<p>There are two ways you can collapse the sidebar and filetree.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using collapse icons</li>
<li>Double click the panel dividers</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="heading"> <a name="using-collapse-icons" class="anchor" href="#using-collapse-icons"></a> Using collapse icons </h3><p>Both the sidebar and the file tree have handy icons that will cause the respective panels to

        <p>Sometimes, after you&apos;re installed a slew of software and things have started to conflict,
there&apos;s a need to send your VM back to its original state. To achieve that, Koding offers
an easy reinitialization function which you can use at any time you like.</p>
<h4 class="heading"> <a name="what-does-reinitialization-do-" class="anchor" href="#what-does-reinitialization-do-"></a> What does reinitialization do? </h4><p>When you reinit your VM, the system will delete everything on your VM and create a new one from
scratch.</p>
<blockquote class="alert fa fa-exclamation-circle"> <p><span class="label">alert</span><strong>NOTE: You will lose all existing data (unless you back it up somewhere) on the VM
that you are reinitializing. This is an irreversible process so please proceed with caution.</strong> To backup
your data, we recommend you <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/setting-up-ftp-on-koding/">use FTP</a>
to transfer the files.</p>
 </blockquote><p>Reinitialization will however preserve your VM settings and any domain names that you may have created.</p>
<h4 class="heading"> <a name="how-do-i-reinit-my-vm-" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-reinit-my-vm-"></a> How do I reinit my VM? </h4><p>To reinit your VM, follow these easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>head over to the <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/understanding-vm-panel/">VM settings modal</a> (as shown in the screen shot below)</li>
<li>turn your VM to &quot;on&quot; state (if it is off)</li>
<li>then click on the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab</li>
<li>click the &quot;Reinitialize&quot; button inside the Advanced section to begin the reinit process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you initiate a reinit, you will see appropriate messages on the screen as your VM rebuilds.

        <p>Koding gives you access to your VMs IP, as well as an Address that
always points to that VM&apos;s IP, so which should you use, and why?</p>
<p>While your VMs IP will operate perfectly fine, the IP is dynamic. In
other words, it will change. Because of this, Koding gives you a <a href="/faq/vm-address">VM
Address</a>, which will <em>always</em> point to your VM, regardless of
IP changes, so this is what you usually want to use.</p>
<blockquote class="tip fa fa-check-circle"> <p><span class="label">tip</span>IP addresses of &quot;Always On&quot; VMs don&apos;t change even after the VM reboots.</p>

        <p>Sometimes one editor or terminal screen is not enough, so just like you can on any code editor and terminal app on your computer, you can also split the editor and terminal areas on Koding to gain more virtual windows.</p>
<p>The image below shows the first method you can use to split panes. The drop-down menu provides the split options.
<img src="/faq/split-panes/split-1.png" alt="split-1"></p>
<p>The second (and more fun) method of splitting panes is to use our visual pane splitter as shown in
the animated gif below.</p>
<p>Simply move your mouse to the center of a pane (horizontal or vertical center) and you will see a animated/visual split bar appear showing you a preview of the split. click to make it permanent!</p>

        <p>There are a variety of tools for Ubuntu that you can install on your VM in order to monitor traffic and network usage. Listed below are three of our favorites.</p>
<blockquote class="tip fa fa-check-circle"> <p><span class="label">tip</span>Before installing any of the tools mentioned below, make sure you update your
repositories by using the command: <code>sudo apt-get update</code></p>
 </blockquote><ol>
<li><strong>nload</strong>: This tool allows users you to monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic separately. It also draws out an ascii graph to indicate the same, the scale of which can be adjusted. Easy and simple to use, and does not support many options. So if you just need to take a quick look at the total bandwidth usage without details of individual processes, then nload will be handy.
To install, type the following command in Terminal:<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install nload -y
</code></pre>and then to run, type:<pre><code>nload
</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>iftop</strong>: This tool measures the data flowing through individual socket connections, and it works in a manner that is different from Nload. Iftop uses the pcap library to capture the packets moving in and out of the network adapter, and then sums up the size and count to find the total bandwidth under use. Although iftop reports the bandwidth used by individual connections, it cannot report the process name/id involved in the particular socket connection. But being based on the pcap library, iftop is able to filter the traffic and report bandwidth usage over selected host connections as specified by the filter.
To install, type the following command in Terminal:<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install iftop -y
</code></pre>and then to run, type:<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">sudo</span> iftop -n
</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>iptraf</strong>: This is an interactive and colorful IP Lan monitor. It shows individual connections and the amount of data flowing between the hosts.
To install, type the following command in Terminal:<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install iptraf iptraf-ng -y
</code></pre>and then to run, type:<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">sudo</span> iptraf
</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>nethogs</strong>: This is a small &apos;net top&apos; tool that shows the bandwidth used by individual processes and sorts the list putting the most intensive processes on top. In the event of a sudden bandwidth spike, quickly open nethogs and find the process responsible. Nethogs reports the PID, user and the path of the program.
To install, type the following command in Terminal:<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install nethogs -y
</code></pre>and then to run, type:<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">sudo</span> nethogs
</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>vnstat</strong>: This utility is bit different from most of the other tools. It actually runs a background service/daemon and keeps recording the size of data transfer all the time. Next it can be used to generate a report of the history of network usage. Vnstat is more like a tool to get historic reports of how much bandwidth is used everyday or over the past month. It is not strictly a tool for monitoring the network in real time.
To install, type the following command in Terminal:<pre><code>sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install vnstat -y
</code></pre>and then to run, type:<pre><code>sudo <span class="hljs-keyword">service</span> <span class="hljs-literal">start</span> vnstat
</code></pre>Running vnstat without any options would simply show the total amount of data transfer that took place since the date the daemon is running. To monitor the bandwidth usage in realtime, use the <code>-l</code> option (live mode). It would then show the total bandwidth used by incoming and outgoing data, but in a very precise manner without any internal details about host connections or processes.  </li>

        <p>To switch to the <code>root</code> user on your VM, simply type in:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">sudo</span> su
</code></pre><p>By default, there is no <code>sudo</code> password on your Koding VM. It is blank/empty.</p>
<p>So, if you want to use run a command as the root user, all you need to do is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo &lt;command you wish <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">use</span>&gt;
</code></pre><p>When you hit enter, the sudo level command you wish to run without a password prompt.</p>
<p>If you wish to, you can add a sudo password yourself. To do this, change user to root by typing:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">sudo</span> su
</code></pre><p>and then create a password for the root user by typing:</p>
<pre><code>passwd
</code></pre><p>You will be asked to type in the new password twice. Once done, the new password you picked is the password you will need to use when
using the <code>sudo</code> command from that point on.</p>

        <p>Most Unix ports are available on Koding VMs. We do not block any TCP traffic
(inbound or outbound). See the following list for open ports, as well as ports in use by default.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ports <strong>2</strong> through <strong>65,534</strong> are open.</li>
<li>Port <strong>80</strong> is taken by Apache, but this can be turned off to free up the port. To turn
off Apache, type in: <code>sudo service apache2 stop</code> in Terminal.</li>
<li>Ports <strong>2</strong> through <strong>1,024</strong> require <code>sudo</code> access.</li>

        <p>The system assigned name for your VM is available on VM settings modal under the label: <em>Assigned URL</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="tip fa fa-check-circle"> <p><span class="label">tip</span>This is an assigned name and is not editable.</p>
 </blockquote><p>We realize that most users will probably run into trouble trying to remember our creatively designed VM names
(sorry, we had to make sure they were unique) so Koding VMs can also very easily be assigned a username based
namespace (username.koding.io). This makes it easy to remember the domain name for your VM since it is your
username! (Note: You can still reach the VM by using the system assigned name as described above.)</p>
<p>To assign your username based domain to a VM, follow these 2 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>open the <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/understanding-vm-panel/">VM settings modal</a> and click on the &quot;Domains&quot; tab to reveal the domain settings (as shown in the image below)</li>
<li>toggle the switch next to your personal namespace to enable it for this VM. (Note: If you have more than one VM, you will be able to reassign the same namespace on other VM settings modals but only one VM can have the namespace applied to it at any given time.)
<img src="/faq/vm-hostname/first.png" alt="Personal namespace"></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to this, Koding also allows you to create sub-domains
so that if you want to configure your apache/nginx web server to serve multiple
virtual hosts, it&apos;s easy to assign them all their own unique sub-domains. <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-to-serve-multiple-domains-using-virtual-hosts">Read more about virtual hosts.</a></p>
<p>To use this feature, head back to the VM settings modal and follow these 3 easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>click on the &quot;Domains&quot; tab in the VM settings modal</li>
<li>click the &quot;Add new domain&quot; button to open up an input box where you can type in a new sub-domain. All you need to provide is the sub-domain, we will add the .username.koding.io part automatically.
<img src="/faq/vm-hostname/second.png" alt="Add subdomain"></li>
<li>once added, these sub-domains become available on the setting modals of all your VMs for easy reassignment</li>
<li>deleting a sub-domain is as easy as adding one!

        <p>To turn off your VM, we recommend that you use the power on/off toggle in the <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/understanding-vm-panel/">VM settings modal</a>. This ensures that all internal API calls are triggered and all Koding services are aware that you have powered down your VM.</p>
<blockquote class="tip fa fa-check-circle"> <p><span class="label">tip</span>VMs for our free accounts automatically turn off after 60 minutes of inactivity on our IDE or Terminal
so there&apos;s no need to manually turn the VM off.</p>
 </blockquote><p>That being said, sometimes you may need to restart your VM and want to do it via the Terminal. In such cases, simple type the following command in Terminal:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">sudo</span> reboot
</code></pre><p>you will see the following msg on your Terminal while the reboot command is processed and your VM restarts</p>
<pre><code>connecting<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>
</code></pre><p>followed by</p>
<pre><code>Failed <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> connect <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> terminal, click here <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> again.
</code></pre><p>followed by</p>
<pre><code>An unknown error occured, please <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">new</span> <span class="hljs-constant">tab</span>. Click here <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> dismiss this <span class="hljs-constant">one</span>.
</code></pre><p>both of the above messages, even though they look like errors are normal because a manual reboot has been requested.</p>
<p>We don&apos;t recommend using <code>sudo poweroff</code> or <code>sudo shutdown</code> to power down your VM as it will leave the associated sub-systems in an unknown state which may disrupt you from using your account. Use the <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/understanding-vm-panel/">VM settings modal</a> to stop/turn off your VM.</p>

        <p>If you try to use MySQL and receive an error that looks similar to the
following:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR <span class="hljs-number">2002</span> (HY000): Can&apos;t connect <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">local</span> MySQL server <span class="hljs-keyword">through</span> socket
&apos;/var/<span class="hljs-command">run</span>/mysqld/mysqld.sock&apos;
</code></pre><p>First, make sure MySQL is installed and running on your VM. To install
MySQL, follow this <a href="http://learn.koding.com/guides/installing-mysql/">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have confirmed that MySQL is installed, start it by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo <span class="hljs-keyword">service</span> mysql <span class="hljs-literal">start</span>
</code></pre><p>This should get rid of the <code>Socket Error 2002</code> error.</p>
<p>If not, send us an email at support@koding.com and we can troubleshoot for you.</p>
